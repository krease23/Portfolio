        Hey everyone. My name is Kermit Bonner I'm a fourth generation Kermit. Every one I know calls me Chris or Kerm tho. I am an aspiring developer. I have a 2 year old daughter named Charlie. She is the main reason I am pursuing a career in web development. I have a background in customer facing and sales. I bring a technical background to a professional salesman. I can interact with any customer, speak with large groups and able to interact well with a development team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a major passion for anything competitive. I think that's what made me such a good salesman. I love just about all professional sports especially football and baseball. I'm a avid fantasy football nut. I stay up to date with as many video games as possible.
